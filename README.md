# ConfigLib

ConfigLib is a PHP library for managing configuration files and storing it
in NCC's data, while providing a command line interface for running functions
such as editing configuration files inline or importing/exporting 
configuration files.

One of the biggest advantages of using something like ConfigLib is that 
it will allow for more complicated software to be configured more easily
by following the documented instructions on how to alter configuration
files, optionally you could use a builtin editor to edit the configuration
file manually.
